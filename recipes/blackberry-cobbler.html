        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This easy Blackberry Cobbler recipe from The Pioneer Woman takes just 5 ingredients and 10 minutes to prepare. It’s got a sweet, juicy filling and a sugary golden crust!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/4 cups + 2 tablespoons sugar, separated</li>
            <li>1 cup self-rising flour</li>
            <li>1 cup milk, any kind, whole is best</li>
            <li>1/2 stick butter, melted</li>
            <li>2 cups fresh or frozen blackberries, rinsed and patted dry</li>
            <li>Vanilly ice cream, for serving</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Note: If using frozen berries, be sure to add them when they're frozen. If you let them thaw, they'll be mushy, and the consistency will be off.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.</li>
            <li>Combine 1 cup of sugar with the flour in a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Stir in the milk, then the melted butter. Mix until well-combined.</li>
            <li>Pour onto the bottom of a greased 9 x 9 inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>Distribute the berries throughout the top. They'll sink in further as they bake.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle ¼ cup sugar over the top, reserving 2 tablespoons for later.</li>
            <li>Bake for 50 minutes. Remove from the oven and sprinkle remaining 2 tablespoons sugar on top.</li>
            <li>Bake for 10 minutes, or until the top is golden brown.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately, (with ice cream of course)!</li>
        </ol>
