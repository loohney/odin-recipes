            <li>4 Tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups half and half</li>

            <li>1/4 teaspoon EACH: onion powder, dried thyme, salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon EACH: drieg oregano, dried parsley</li>
            <li>3 1/2 cups broccoli florets, uncooked</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons lemon juice</li>
            <li>3/4 cup Parmesan Cheese, finely grated into a powder</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Measure out all ingredients prior to beginning. (This is called “mise en place” and is a good idea for quick recipes.) Pro Tip: Cut the broccoli into smaller pieces so that they cook more quickly.</li>
            <li>Melt butter over medium heat in a large skillet. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken broth, half and half, and seasonings.</li>
            <li>Bring to a boil and add the pasta. Submerge the pasta into the liquid and let it return to a boil. Cook partially covered according to package instructions. Add the broccoli during the last 6 minutes. Run a silicone spatula along the bottom of the pan occasionally to prevent the pasta from sticking to it.</li>
            <li>Remove cover taste-test a pasta noodle for doneness before proceeding. If needed, cover and cook longer, until your desired doneness is obtained.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat. Add the lemon juice and use a silicone spatula to gently mix in the Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Sauce will continue to thicken upon standing. Garnish with parsley and serve with <a href="./garlic-bread-cheese.html">garlic bread with cheese.</a></li>
        </ol>
