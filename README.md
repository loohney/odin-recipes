I've been working with HTML/CSS and Sass for over 7 years now and figured it's time to add JS to the list of skills I have.
For that i've chosen The Odin Project based on several reviews from people i personally know and from online reviews.

Project "Odin Recipes" simply wants us to create a recipe website with plain HTML, no CSS and therefore no styling at all.
This project also requires us to manually use GIT to stage and commit the files of this project.
